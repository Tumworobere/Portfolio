# My-Portfolio
This is my second microverse project. In this project I built a first page of my portfolio(Skeleton).Thismarks the very first step for the portfolio project.The main objective for this project was to build template from figma using CSS and Flexbox. I created my-portfolio reposotory and cloned into my local machine. I have implemented linters,Github Flow and professional documentation which is one of the project building requirements at microverse.
