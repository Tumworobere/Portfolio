# My-Portfolio
This is my second project in the Microverse in which I built my portfolio . This is my responsive desktop version. The objective was to build template from figma by using CSS Flexbox. For that I created my-portfolio repository and cloned into my local machine.I have implemented linter,Github Flow and professional documentation which is one of the project building requirements at microverse.

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

    Enter git clone git@github.com:Tumworobere/Portfolio.gitt into terminal

    Open in browser to view site.
